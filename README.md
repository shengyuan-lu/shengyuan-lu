## Hi, I'm Shengyuan 👋🏻
I am an engineer by training, a software developer by profession, and a creative artist by heart.

## About
If what I want doesn’t exist, I build it from scratch. From the chemistry board game I designed in high school to my newest iOS app ZotMeal, I am obsessed with turning ideas into reality. Currently, products I designed, developed, and marketed serve users in over 60 countries, and I couldn’t be more proud knowing my work has a big impact.
