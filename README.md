## Hi, I'm Shengyuan 👋🏻

If what I want doesn’t exist, I build it from scratch. From the chemistry board game I designed in high school to my newest iOS app ZotMeal, I am obsessed with turning ideas into reality. Currently, products I designed, developed, and marketed serve over 3,500 users in 60 countries, and I couldn't be more proud knowing my work has a big impact.
